9. [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) 
   Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor that lets you type in and play around with text or code in amazing ways. It rose into prominence recently, but there are lots of alternatives for the “slickest code editor” crown. Some that are worth watching are github’s new Atom editor and Adobe’s Brackets. Not to mention VIM and Emacs, which have been around for quite a while and have large communities of developers using them.

11. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    Heroku was the first major player in the platform as a service boom that hit developers by storm. Before it, we relied on cheap hosting providers with horrible reliability to host our websites (or setting up our own servers). But heroku introduced git push deployments and we were spoiled for life. If you want to be in full control of your servers, you might want to try dokku instead.
	<iframe src="https://www.heroku.com/" width="480" height="480" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;"> </iframe>

12. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
    Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environments. With an easy-to-use workflow, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time to make the “works on my machine” excuse a relic of the past. There is another popular way for running virtual machines with other operating systems on your computer – VirtualBox.

## Image processing

1. [Real Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/)

5. [Pic Resize](http://www.picresize.com/)

   <iframe src="http://www.picresize.com/" width="480" height="480" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;"> </iframe>

2. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
   Git made version control accessible to the masses, and Github revolutionized the way developers collaborate. Github is the most popular repository hosting website in the world and gives you an unlimited number of public repositories for free.
